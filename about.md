Phil has been working on hard core IT problems since 1988. For 14 years his primary job was writing control systems for robots that inspected and repaired
Nuclear Power stations. His idea of a test rig was a 10 acre site with a twelve story mechano-set for the robots to be tested in.

Co-Founder of Erudine, he developed a new type of machine/human learning that was intended to solve a specific set of difficult problems simply. Those problems 
were the case where there is complicated business logic that is difficult to extract from human experts or legacy machines. The technology was particularly
effective at Reverse Engineering Legacy Systems. In many ways the software was a development of Test Driven Development.

Post Erudine Phil has worked in a variety of areas. From Eclipse Plugins that help programmer productivity and communication. He has created an open source
toolkit that is 'what he would of written if he was starting again' to help deal with the Legacy Reverse Engineering. Much of his time has been spent on 
work in cryptography, identity and providing specialised services to Credit Unions who provide basic banking provisions for the poorest in society. 

His hobbies include Creative Writing, Role Playing, and Martial Arts. He teaches Tai Chi to 'Little Old Ladies' as a charitable activity under the auspices of 
Age Concern, and is an indoor student of Master Kit Hui in a style known as Liu He Ba Fa
